Here you'll find a collection of security workshops and other hands-on content that will guide you through prepared scenarios that represent common use cases and security operational tasks on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The workshops align loosely to the [Security Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/new-whitepaper-now-available-the-security-perspective-of-the-aws-cloud-adoption-framework/) and provide a deep dive into a variety of AWS security services, techniques, and best practices that'll you'll be able to apply to your own environments to better improve your security posture.
