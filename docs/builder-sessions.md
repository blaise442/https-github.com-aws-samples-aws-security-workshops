                <td align="left">In this hands-on builder session, you will walk through a scenario covering threat detection and remediation using Amazon GuardDuty; a managed threat detection service. The scenario simulates an attack that spans a few threat vectors, representing just a small sample of the threats that GuardDuty is able to detect.  In addition, you will look at how to view and analyze GuardDuty findings, how to send alerts based on the findings, and, finally, how to remediate findings.

                <td align="left">In this hands-on builder session, we help you identify which cloud-native solutions can mitigate the same risks while providing scalability, reliability, and cost optimization at a low operational burden. During this workshop, you will learn how to use cloud native controls like CloudTrail, Security Groups, GuardDuty and many more, to secure your cloud architecture.

                <td align="left">This Secrets Manager Builder Session guides you through the use of AWS Secrets Manager with Amazon RDS and AWS Fargate. In the first phase of the Builder Session, you will access the RDS data base with Secrets Manager. You will then use Secrets Manager to rotate the data base password. You will then use Secrets Manager to access the data base again to show that you can continue to access the data base after the rotation.</br></br> 
                In the second phase of the Builder Session, you will extend your use of Secrets Manager into an AWS Fargate container. You will create an Amazon ECS task definition to pass secrets to the Fargate container and then launch the Fargate container. You will then SSH into the container to show that the secret was passed to the container and that you can access the RDS data base.
